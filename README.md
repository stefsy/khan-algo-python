# Khan Academy's Algorithms in Python

Porting Khan Academy's [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) from Javascript to Python. 

Meant for novice Python programmers who want to learn algorithms, but don't want to learn Javascript just to get through this excellent short course. All function names, variable names, and logic similar to the original Javascript code created through the course

To do:
1. sample code - done
2. unit tests
3. proper readme with links 
4. instructions on how to run unit tests - done


## Sample Code

- [x] Binary Search
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Recursion
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Breadth-first search

## Unit Tests

- [ ] Binary Search
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [x] Breadth-first search

## How To 

0. Clone this repo 
1. Go through each section of Khan Academy's Algorithms tutorials
2. Implement the algorithsm by filling out the functions in each algorithm's `.py` file 
3. Run the `_test.py` file associated with each algorithm 
4. Correct errors until your implementation passes all the test cases
5. Take a look at the `_sample.py` file to see how your implementation compares 
6. Make a pull request with any improvements you want to see!
