# khan-algo-python
porting https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms to python

Aimed towards novices. Sample code isn't quite pythonic because I'm trying to maximize understanding by keeping the the function names, variable names, and logic similar to the original javascript. 

To do:
1. sample code
2. unit tests
3. proper readme with links 
4. instructions on how to run unit tests 


## Sample Code

- [x] Binary Search
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Recursion
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [ ] Graph representation
- [ ] Breadth-first search

## Unit Tests

- [ ] Binary Search
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Graph representation
- [ ] Breadth-first search
